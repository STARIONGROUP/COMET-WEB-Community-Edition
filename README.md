## Concurrent Design

The Concurrent Design method is an approach to design activities in which all design disciplines and stakeholders are brought together to create an integrated design in a collaborative way of working.

The Concurrent Design method brings many advantages to the early design phase by providing a structure for this otherwise chaotic phase. Many design concepts have been implemented in the Concurrent Design method to help a team of stakeholders perform their task. The design work is done in collocated sessions with all stakeholders involved and present, creating an integrated design and enabling good communication and exchange of information between team members.

## Web Application Build and Deploy using Docker - Manual

The CDP4-COMET-WEB SPA is built using docker and the result is a Docker container ready to be deployed (or pushed to Docker Hub). The Docker file is located in the COMETwebapp project folder.

> The Docker command needs to be executed from the commandline in the **solution** folder. Please note that the docker file is a multi-stage docker file. In the first stage the application is built using the private DevExpress nuget feed. In order to access this nuget feed, it is required to EXPORT the API-KEY to an environment variable.

```
$ ./solutionfolder# export DEVEXPRESS_NUGET_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>
$ ./solutionfolder# DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --secret id=DEVEXPRESS_NUGET_KEY,env=DEVEXPRESS_NUGET_KEY -f COMETwebapp/Dockerfile -t rheagroup/comet-web-community-edition:latest -t rheagroup/comet-web-community-edition:<specific-version> .
$ ./solutionfolder# docker run -p 8080:8080 --name comet-web rheagroup/comet-web-community-edition:latest
```

Push to docker hub

```
$ ./solutionfolder# docker push rheagroup/comet-web-community-edition:latest
$ ./solutionfolder# docker push rheagroup/comet-web-community-edition:<specific-version>
```
